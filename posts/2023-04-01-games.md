# Games 4 fun

Just a little note about apps, games, settings for next time playing :D Please
have fun, of course :D

I have tested all software below on:

- My work laptop (Macbook Pro M1 (2020)).

If below links die, I will try to scrape Internet to get a new link.

## PS2 emulator

I use [PCSX2](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2). Currently it supports macOS on
nightly builds, but it's good enough.

Should download BIOS, I go with USA version:

- [Here](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Emulator_files#PlayStation_2)
- [Another here](https://cdromance.com/bios-files/)

Should enable cheats:

For cover art of games, please use
[xlenore/ps2-covers](https://github.com/xlenore/ps2-covers).

### [Resident Evil 4](https://wiki.pcsx2.net/Resident_Evil_4)

You can download it [here](https://cdromance.com/ps2-iso/resident-evil-4-usa/).

I recommend to use
[HD textures](https://gbatemp.net/threads/resident-evil-4-hd-textures-update-2.615869/),
it's better for your eyes.
[Direct download link](https://www.mediafire.com/file/eyspelayfqtfz7a/R.4.hd.textures.xXthe.RockoXx.rar/file)
if forum dies. Please give thanks to
[xXtheRockoXx](https://ko-fi.com/xxtherockoxx) for his work.

After download HD textures, please extract then copy to PCSX2 texture folder.
Remember to rename it to serial name (SLUS-21134, ...), because different region
has different serial name.

Settings below are for Resident Evil 4 only.

If using macOS please switch Graphics/Renderer to Vulkan. For other OS, I
haven't tested yet.

In Graphics/Rendering:

- Internal Resolution: 3x Native
- Anisotropic Filtering: 16x

![pcsx2-002](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haunt98/posts-images/main/pcsx2-002.png)

In Graphics/Texture Replacement:

- Enable Load Textures
- Disbale Async Texture Loading
- Disable Precache Textures

![pcsx2-003](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haunt98/posts-images/main/pcsx2-003.png)

In Graphics/Post-Processing:

- Sharpening/Anti-Aliasing: Sharpen and Resize
- Sharpness: 30%

![pcsx2-004](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haunt98/posts-images/main/pcsx2-004.png)

For hacking, create file with content below in PCSX2 cheat folder. Remember to
rename it to crc.pnach (013E349D.pnach, ...).

```txt
// Money
patch=1,EE,2042DA6C,extended,05F5E0FF

// Infinite Health Leon
patch=1,EE,001c27f8,word,00401023

// Infinite Health Ashley
patch=1,EE,001c293c,word,00401023

// Infinite Ammo
