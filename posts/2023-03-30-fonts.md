# Fonts

I always want the best fonts for my terminal, my text editor, my ... But I'm not
satisfied easily, so I keep trying new fonts. Prefer free fonts of course :D

TLDR:

On macOS, use [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) for
everything. Remember each time macOS release new version/new update, you should
download again to get (maybe) latest version.

Otherwise:

- Use [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono) for code.
- Use [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) for everything else.

All images belows is either official images I got from fonts website or my own
screenshots. I'm too lazy to screenshot anw :D

## [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono)

JetBrains branding font.

- Support Vietnamese
- Support bold, italic
- Support ligatures
- Has dotted zero

![img00](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/raw/master/images/character-set@2x.png)

Ligatures I prefer: `ss02`, `cv04`, `cv16`, `cv18`, `cv19`, `cv20`.

## [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)

I often choose SS08 variant because I also love PragmataPro too.

- Support Vietnamese
- Support bold, italic
- Support ligatures
- Has dotted zero
- Has display font

Font is narrow, can display much more on small screen. But too much
config/variant for ligatures scares me.

## [Recursive](https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive)

I often choose Casual variant.

- Support Vietnamese
- Support bold, italic
- Support ligatures
- Has dotted zero
- Has display font

Ligatures I prefer: `ss10`, `ss12`.

Looks good on my phone.

## [agave](https://github.com/blobject/agave)

- No Vietnamese
- Support bold
- No italic
- No ligatures
- Has dotted zero

Font is small, can display much more on small screen. I like its curved look.

## [Sudo](https://github.com/jenskutilek/sudo-font)

Small fonts, saving space.

- Support Vietnamese
- Support bold, italic
- No ligatures
- Has dotted zero
- Has display font

Unique to me. Strange `#`, looks same as `4` (I don't like it for now).

## [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans)

Comic vibe. Look smoothly and too much curve.

- No Vietnamese
- Support bold, italic
- Support ligatures

## [APL-385](https://apl385.com/fonts/index.htm) and [APL386](https://github.com/abrudz/APL386)

- No Vietnamese
- No bold, italic
- No ligatures (APL-385 not APL386)
- Has display font (APL333)

I love its wide look, also it's feel nostalgic.

## [IBM Plex](https://github.com/IBM/plex)

IBM branding font, good alternative for Inter, has both monospace and display
variant.

- Support Vietnamese
- Support bold, italic
- No ligatures
- Has dotted zero
- Has display font

Looks fancy. Strange `#`.

## [Hermit](https://github.com/pcaro90/hermit)

- No Vietnamese

- No ligatures

Looks unique to me, with some sharp look.

## [Martian Mono](https://github.com/evilmartians/mono)

- No Vietnamese
- Support bold
- No italic
- No ligatures

Font is wide, remember to edit line height to make it looks good. I like its
bold, strong look.
