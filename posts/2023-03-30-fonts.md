# Fonts

I always want the best fonts for my terminal, my text editor, my ...
But I'm not satisfied easily, so I keep trying new fonts.
Prefer free fonts of course :D

TLDR:

- Use [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono) for code.
- Use [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) for everything else.

All images belows is either official images I got from fonts website or my own screenshots.
I'm too lazy to screenshot anw :D

## [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono)

- Support Vietnamese
- Support bold, italic
- Support ligatures

## [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)

I often choose SS08 variant because I also love [PragmataPro](https://fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/) too.

- Support Vietnamese
- Support bold, italic
- Support ligatures
- Support display font (non mono)

Font is narrow, can display much more on small screen.
But too much config/variant for ligatures scares me.

## [agave](https://github.com/blobject/agave)

I like its curved look.

Looks unique to me, with some sharp look.

I love its wide look, also it's feel nostalgic.

## [Cozette](https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette)

Feel 8-bit vibe, mono to death.
But sometimes it's hard to read.

## Murr fonts, but I don't use much

- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode): best ligatures.
- [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code): seems discontinued :(.
- [Input](https://input.djr.com/): seems discontinued :(.
- [Monoid](https://github.com/larsenwork/monoid): seems discontinued :(.
- [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans): Comic fonts vibe, seems discontinued :(.
