# Fonts

I always want the best fonts for my terminal, my text editor, my ... But I'm not
satisfied easily, so I keep trying new fonts. Prefer free fonts of course :D

TLDR:

If use macOS, use [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) for
everything. Remember each time macOS release new version/new update, you should
download again to get (maybe) latest version.

Otherwise:

- Use [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono) for code.
- Use [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) for everything else.

All images belows is either official images I got from fonts website or my own
screenshots. I'm too lazy to screenshot anw :D

## [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono)

- Support Vietnamese
- Support bold, italic
- Support ligatures

## [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)

I often choose SS08 variant because I also love
[PragmataPro](https://fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/) too.

- Support Vietnamese
- Support bold, italic
- Support ligatures
- Support display font (non mono)

Font is narrow, can display much more on small screen. But too much
config/variant for ligatures scares me.

## [Recursive](https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive)

I often choose Casual variant.

- Support Vietnamese
- Support bold, italic
- Support ligatures
- Support display font (non mono)

Looks good on my phone.

## [Martian Mono](https://github.com/evilmartians/mono)

- No Vietnamese
- Support bold

Font is wide, remember to edit line height to make it looks good. I like its
bold, strong look.

## [agave](https://github.com/blobject/agave)

Font is small, can display much more on small screen. I like its curved look.

## [Hermit](https://github.com/pcaro90/hermit)

Looks unique to me, with some sharp look.

## [APL-385](https://apl385.com/fonts/index.htm) and [APL386](https://github.com/abrudz/APL386)

- No Vietnamese
- No bold, italic

I love its wide look, also it's feel nostalgic.

## [Cozette](https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette)

- No Vietnamese
- No bold, italic
- No ligatures

Feel 8-bit vibe, mono to death. But sometimes it's hard to read.
