# Fonts

I always want the best fonts for my terminal, my text editor, my ...
But I'm not satisfied easily, so I keep trying new fonts.
Prefer free fonts of course :D

TLDR:

- Use [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono) for code.
- Use [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) for everything else.

All images belows is official images I got from fonts website or github.

I often choose SS08 variant because I also love [PragmataPro](https://fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/) too.
