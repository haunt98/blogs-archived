# Things I like

The way Discord naming user like`Joker#1234` is so interesting.
If user A register first with name `ABCXYZ`, and later user B register with name `ABCXYZ` too, user A, user B will have name `ABCXYZ#1`, `ABCXYZ#2` respectively.

Why it's interesting?
Each time I join a new platform, all names I want are taken :D
