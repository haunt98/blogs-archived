rclone sync MyBooks remote:MyBooks -P --exclude .DS_Store

# Sync from remote to local
rclone sync remote:MyBooks MyBooks -P --exclude .DS_Store
</code></pre><p>Before you use Rclone to sync to Google Drive, you should read <a href=https://rclone.org/drive/>Google Drive rclone configuration</a> first.<p>The next data is my passwords and my OTPs.<br>These are the things which I'm scare to lose the most.<br>First thing first, I enable 2-Step Verification for all of my important accounts, should use both OTP and phone method.<p>I use Bitwarden for passwords (That is a long story, coming from Google Password manager to Firefox Lockwise and then settle down with Bitwarden) and Aegis for OTPs.<br>The reason I choose Aegis, not Authy (I use Authy for so long but Aegis is definitely better) is because Aegis allows me to extract all the OTPs to a single file (Can be encrypted), which I use to transfer or backup easily.<p>As long as Bitwarden provides free passwords stored, I use all of its apps, extensions so that I can easily sync passwords between laptops and phones.<br>The thing I need to remember is the master password of Bitwarden in my head.<p>With Aegis, I export the data, then sync it to Google Drive, also store it locally in my phone.<br>For safety, I also store Aegis data locally on all of my laptops (Encrypted of course).<p>The main problem here is the OTP, I can not store all of my OTPs in the cloud completely.<br>Because if I want to access my OTPs in the cloud, I should log in, and then input my OTP, this is a circle, my friends.<h2>Recovery strategy</h2><p>There are many strategies that I process to react as if something strange is happening to my devices.<p>If I lost my laptops, single laptop or all, do not panic as long as I have my phones.<br>The OTPs are in there, the passwords are in Bitwarden cloud, other data is in Google Drive so nothing is lost here.<p>If I lost my phone, but not my laptops, I use the OTPs which are stored locally in my laptops.<p>In the worst situation, I lost everything, my laptops, my phone.<br>The first step is to recover my SIM, then log in to Google account using the password and SMS OTP.<br>After that, log in to Bitwarden account using the master password and OTP from Gmail, which I open previously.<h2>The end</h2><p>This guide will be updated regularly I promise.
