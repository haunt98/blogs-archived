      The purpose is that I want my data to be safe, secure, and can be easily
      recovered if I lost some devices; or in the worst situation, I lost all.
      Because you know, it is hard to guess what is waiting for us in the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 2 sections which I want to share, the first is
      <strong>How to backup</strong>, the second is
      <strong>Recover strategy</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a
        id="user-content-how-to-backup"
        class="anchor"
        aria-hidden="true"

      >How to backup
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before I talk about backup, I want to talk about data. In specifically,
      which data should I backup?
    </p>
    <p>
      I use Arch Linux and macOS, primarily work in the terminal so I have too
      many dotfiles, for example, <code>~/.config/nvim/init.lua</code>. Each
      time I reinstall Arch Linux (I like it a lot), I need to reconfigure all
      the settings, and it is time-consuming.
    </p>
    <p>
      So for the DE and UI settings, I keep it as default as possible, unless
      it's getting in my way, I leave the default setting there and forget about
      it. The others are dotfiles, which I write my own
      <a href="https://github.com/haunt98/dotfiles">dotfiles tool</a> to backup
      and reconfigure easily and quickly. Also, I know that installing Arch
      Linux is not easy, despite I install it too many times (Like thousand
      times since I was in high school). Not because it is hard, but as life
      goes on, the
      <a
        href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide"
        rel="nofollow"
        >official install guide</a
      >
      keeps getting new update and covering too many cases for my own personal
      use, so I write my own
      <a href="https://github.com/haunt98/til/blob/main/install-archlinux.md"
        >guide</a
      >
      to quickly capture what I need to do. I back up all my dotfiles in GitHub
      and GitLab as I trust them both. Also as I travel the Internet, I discover
      <a href="https://codeberg.org/" rel="nofollow">Codeberg</a> and
      <a href="https://gitea.treehouse.systems/" rel="nofollow">Treehouse</a>
      and use them as another backup for git repo.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that is my dotfiles, for my regular data, like Wallpaper or Books,
      Images, I use Google Drive (Actually I pay for it). But the step: open the
      webpage, click the upload button and choose files seems boring and
      time-consuming. So I use Rclone, it supports Google Drive, One Drive and
      many providers but I only use Google Drive for now. The commands are
      simple:
    </p>
    <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
      <pre><span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Sync from local to remote</span>
rclone sync MyBooks remote:MyBooks -P --exclude .DS_Store

<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Sync from remote to local</span>
rclone sync remote:MyBooks MyBooks -P --exclude .DS_Store</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      Before you use Rclone to sync to Google Drive, you should read
      <a href="https://rclone.org/drive/" rel="nofollow"
        >Google Drive rclone configuration</a
      >
      first.
    </p>
    <p>For private data, I use restic which can be used with Rclone:</p>
    <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
      <pre><span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Init</span>
restic -r rclone:remote:PrivateData init

<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Backup</span>
restic -r rclone:remote:PrivateData backup PrivateData

<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Cleanup old backups</span>
restic -r rclone:remote:PrivateData forget --keep-last 1 --prune

<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Restore</span>
restic -r rclone:remote:PrivateData restore latest --target <span class="pl-k">~</span></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      The next data is my passwords and my OTPs. These are the things which I'm
      scare to lose the most. First thing first, I enable 2-Step Verification
      for all of my important accounts, should use both OTP and phone method.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use Bitwarden for passwords (That is a long story, coming from Google
      Password manager to Firefox Lockwise and then settle down with Bitwarden)
      and Aegis for OTPs. The reason I choose Aegis, not Authy (I use Authy for
      so long but Aegis is definitely better) is because Aegis allows me to
      extract all the OTPs to a single file (Can be encrypted), which I use to
      transfer or backup easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as Bitwarden provides free passwords stored, I use all of its
      apps, extensions so that I can easily sync passwords between laptops and
      phones. The thing I need to remember is the master password of Bitwarden
      in my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Aegis, I export the data, then sync it to Google Drive, also store it
      locally in my phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main problem here is the OTP, I can not store all of my OTPs in the
      cloud completely. Because if I want to access my OTPs in the cloud, I
      should log in, and then input my OTP, this is a circle, my friends.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a
        id="user-content-recovery-strategy"
        class="anchor"

      >Recovery strategy
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are many strategies that I process to react as if something strange
      is happening to my devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I lost my laptops, single laptop or all, do not panic as long as I have
      my phones. The OTPs are in there, the passwords are in Bitwarden cloud,
      other data is in Google Drive so nothing is lost here.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I lost my phone, but not my laptops, I use the OTPs which are stored
      locally in my laptops.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the worst situation, I lost everything, my laptops, my phone. The first
      step is to recover my SIM, then log in to Google account using the
      password and SMS OTP. After that, log in to Bitwarden account using the
      master password and OTP from Gmail, which I open previously.
